# Yelp Business Insights: Visualization of Restaurant Growth Trends using Yelp Dataset

This project on Yelp Business Insights provides insights with regards to the growth of a restaurant, from the perspective of a business owner. As part of our course on Data Visualisation (CSE 578), my team and I built this dashboard to help owners estimate the performance of their business on the basis of 3 important attributes - neighborhood analysis, restaurant performance analysis and customer sentiment analysis. The dashboard consists of various interactive visualizations that depict key statistics pertaining to the 3 topics mentioned above. Sentiment analysis is performed on the customer reviews to help understand if customers are happy with the restaurant or not. By analyzing these metrics, the restaurant owner can figure out ways to enhance the performance of his business.
